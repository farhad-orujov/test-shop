# Collecting logs

Here are some useful commands to inspect logs of your services:

> üí° **Tip:** Use these commands from the root directory of your project where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

### View all container logs

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

### View logs in real-time

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### View only the last 50 lines

```bash
docker-compose logs --tail=50
```

### View logs of a specific service

```bash
docker-compose logs web
```

### View logs filtered by time

```bash
docker-compose logs --since 1h
```
